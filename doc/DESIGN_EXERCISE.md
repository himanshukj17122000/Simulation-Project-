CRC for Simulation
===

## Classes:

###Main:

Configures the grid
has a loop for which all the 

###Configuration:

Initialize Setup: takes inputs of the grid size, initial state of cells, and the simulation rules


Configure rules: read from input file the rules and then use as inputs to the update state method in 
the simulation class


###Simulation:

update state method takes input of all and has a paramter of configure rules. Executes a step of the simulation
and changes the state of the grid.
###Visualization:
Updates color 
create image
pause simulation
end simulation
adjust speed(int)
